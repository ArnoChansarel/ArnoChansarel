## üíª What I Do

My expertise bridges network defense and low-level system understanding, demonstrated through practical project work:

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Operations & Threat Hunting
* **SIEM Configuration:** Proficient in **Splunk** and the **ELK Stack** for centralized log analysis, alert creation, dashboarding, and security monitoring.
* **Network Intrusion Detection:** Performed traffic analysis and deployed detection rules using **Snort**, **Zeek**, and **Wireshark**.
* **Host Monitoring:** Utilized tools like **Wazuh**, **Sysmon**, and **Osquery** to implement Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) capabilities on Linux environments.

### üí° Threat Intelligence & Automation
* **Threat Intelligence Pipeline:** Engineered a closed-loop TI solution routing alerts from **Snort/Zeek** into **Splunk**, with two-way integration to **OpenCTI** for automated sighting and threat enrichment.
* **Intelligence Tools:** Experienced with **MITRE ATT&CK**, **Yara**, and **MISP** for threat context and rule creation.

### üîß Systems & Low-Level Programming
* **Linux HIDS Toolkit:** Developed a Bash-based toolkit that leverages system monitoring and custom **YARA rules** to simulate and report suspicious activity on a Linux host.
* **Core Systems Programming:** Completed projects in **C** and **C++** focusing on fundamental operating system components (shell implementation, memory allocation, network utilities).

## üöÄ My Projects

These projects showcase my ability to apply complex technical concepts in real-world scenarios:

| Project Title | Core Technologies | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Threat Intelligence Pipeline** | OpenCTI, Splunk, Zeek, Snort, Caldera | Emulated attacks with Caldera and built a fully integrated TI pipeline for automated detection, alerting, and sighting feedback. |
| **Linux HIDS Toolkit** | Bash, YARA, Sysmon/Logging | A custom host-based intrusion detection script for Linux focused on detecting and reporting suspicious activity via log and process analysis. |
| **Limonshello (C Shell)** | C, Unix System Calls | Implementation of a lightweight Unix shell, including process management, command parsing, piping, and redirection. |
| **Custom HTTP Server** | C++, Networking | Low-level implementation of an HTTP server, focusing on networking protocols and handling client requests. |
| **Low-Level Utilities** | C | Reimplementation of core libc functions (e.g., `malloc`), and network tools (e.g., `ping`) to deepen understanding of system fundamentals. |
